# ðŸš€ Java Learning Track â€“ Exercism

Hi! I'm **Jessica**, a 3D artist and texture/model designer for video games, now taking my first steps into the world of programming.

My goal is to become a **Creative Technologist** someone who blends code, art, and design to build interactive and immersive experiences.

This repository documents my progress as I work through the [Exercism Java Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/java).  
Each folder contains my solutions, notes, and small reflections on what Iâ€™m learning.

### ðŸ§° Tools & Topics

- Java (OOP, classes, methods, encapsulation)
- Exercism CLI
- Git & GitHub for tracking my journey

### ðŸŽ¯ Long-term goal

Use my background in 3D modeling and animation to build tools, games, and creative software that merge **technology + storytelling + design**.
