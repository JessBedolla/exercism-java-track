# 🍝 Cook Your Lasagna – Java Exercism Exercise

This exercise simulates the preparation and cooking of a lasagna using Java.  
It was a great way to practice method creation, return values, constants, and basic class structure.

## 🧠 What I learned

- How to create methods that return values and accept parameters
- The importance of naming and structure in class design
- How to replace "magic numbers" with named constants for clean, maintainable code
- Java syntax for constants using `private static final`

## 💬 Reflections

I enjoyed this exercise! It helped me connect abstract concepts like "methods" with real-world ideas (like cooking 🧑‍🍳).  
It also reinforced the value of naming things clearly and keeping code easy to update.
